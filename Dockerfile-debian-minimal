# This is a "minimal" variant of ./Dockerfile-debian that is only used for testing during fast iterative development.

FROM debian:bullseye

## The debian container doesn't come with sudo, so for apt-install.sh which uses sudo to work as everywhere else we install it:
# RUN apt-get update
# RUN apt install sudo
# COPY *.sh /var/local/vorburger-dotfiles/
# RUN /var/local/vorburger-dotfiles/apt-install.sh 11

RUN apt-get update && apt install -y curl gpg
RUN echo 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/shells:/fish:/release:/3/Debian_11/ /' | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/shells:fish:release:3.list
RUN curl -fsSL https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/shells:fish:release:3/Debian_11/Release.key | gpg --dearmor | tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/shells_fish_release_3.gpg > /dev/null

RUN apt-get update && apt install -y fish git

COPY *.sh /var/local/vorburger-dotfiles/
COPY dotfiles /var/local/vorburger-dotfiles/dotfiles/

RUN mv /root/.bashrc /root/.bashrc.original
RUN /var/local/vorburger-dotfiles/symlink.sh
# RUN /var/local/vorburger-dotfiles/symlink-homefree.sh

# COPY etc/profile.d/* /var/local/vorburger-dotfiles/etc/profile.d/
# RUN echo "hello, world from /etc/profile" >>/etc/profile

# ENTRYPOINT fish
